I'm Ã–zge, fully embracing the essence of uniqueness and distinctiveness, just as my name suggests. Armed with a Bachelor's degree in **Computer Engineering** from Sakarya University, I'm currently shaping the future as an **AI Research Engineer** at Huawei. My passion lies in crafting impactful solutions through code, and you're welcome to delve into my GitHub projects for inspiration. If you're as passionate about tech as I am, let's connect! Beyond coding, I share my thoughts and insights on various topics through articles on [my blog](https://ozgecinko.medium.com/).
