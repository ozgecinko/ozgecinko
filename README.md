âœ° My name is Ã–zge and just like the meaning of my name suggests, I'm **unique** and **different**. 

âœ° I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Sakarya University, and I'm enthusiastic about machine learning, natural language processing and software development.

âœ° As an engineer, I thrive on creating innovative tools, and as a developer, I relish solving complex problems, especially when it comes to debugging. My enthusiasm for research leads me to delve deeply into the world of computer science.

âœ° I'm a passionate blogger, regularly sharing my creative insights on various topics through my articles at [here](https://ozgecinko.medium.com/).
